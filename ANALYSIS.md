    One of the weaknesses of my solution's approach when applied to a much larger remote collection of images would be that all caching is done in memory. For 25 images there is no issue with using too much memory, however with a larger collection, there would be serious issues and the images would not fit in memory. One solution would be to cache using the disk (CoreData or Local Storage), however, another solution would just be to clean out the cache when it gets too large, odds are the user is only going to be consistantly accessing few enough photos to fit them in memory.
    Another weakness is that it just fires off threads for every photo in the database, with a large enough database this would easily use up all the avaialable CPU and memory. A strategy for avoiding this would be to only load specific images at a time instead of loading them all right off the bat. For example load 10 images at a time and get the next 10 when the user scrolls down the page far enough.

    A strength of my solution's approach was that it loads all the images asynchronously any uses some caching so that the app isn't constantly performance expensive, time consuming web operations throughout use (and those operations have minimal affect on the UI thread).
